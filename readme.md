# Web Scraper

This is the code for my web scraping using Node.js and Puppeteer.

It scrapes the website https://books.toscrape.com/ but you can change the code to scrape something else.

## Node.js & Puppeteer Usage

Install dependencies

```bash
cd web-scraper-node
npm install
```

Run the file

```bash
node scrape
```
